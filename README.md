## Game Rules

    - Rules are simple as you all know there is no changes in that.

    The game will have a six sided dice numbered from 1 to 6 and will always give a random number on rolling it.

    Each player has a piece which is initially kept outside the board (i.e., at position 0)

    Each player rolls the dice when their turn comes.

    Based on the dice value, the player moves their piece forward that number of cells. Ex: If the dice value is 5 and the piece is at position 21, the player will put their piece at position 26 now (21+5)

    A player wins if it exactly reaches the position 100 and the game ends there.

    After the dice roll, if a piece is supposed to move outside position 100, it does not move.

    The board also contains some snakes and ladders.

## Extra Features

    one of snake bite give you a chance to climb the ladder again.
